# hydrotoolbox v 1.1.0

### Major changes
* The `hydromet_*-classes` now accepts `tibbles`. Also, the 
column classes of the slots could be any (and not just numeric).

* `hm_build_generic()` method has been created. The function allows
for the creation of an `hydromet_station-class` using generic 
raw files.

* The `hydromet_station` class has new slots: outgoing longwave
and shortwave radiation.

### Minor changes
* Package documentation updated.
